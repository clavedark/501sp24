    "text": "Models to understand politics\n\\(~\\)\nThis a methods class, but the methods are only meaningful to us insofar as they help us understand politics. So let’s motivate the class with a question about politics.\n\n\nRepression during the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAmong the products of the pandemic is an opportunity for governments, under the guise of protecting public health, to repress citizens.\nThere is some evidence of democratic backsliding prior to the pandemic, but the global public health crisis gave governments a specific and universal opportunity to take advantage of this softened ground and to become more authoritarian.\nWe’re going to examine the covariates of violence against civilians during the COVID period, focusing on how states of emergency create changes in government violence.\n\n\n\nData\nLet’s look at ACLED event data, and data on states of emergency during the COVID period from Lundgren et al (2020).\nThe next figure (which should look familiar), plots protests and repression since mid-2019, the onset of the pandemic marked at March 15, 2020.\nThe blue lines are local regressions showing trends; while protests return to pre-pandemic levels (similar to the years prior), repression increases since the onset of COVID-19.\n\n\n\nProtests\n\n\ncode\nacled&lt;-read.csv(\"/Users/dave/Documents/2013/PITF/analysis/protests2021/data/2022analysis/acled2022.csv\")\n\n##Event_date variable has a \"Chr\" format. \n#Need to convert it into date format to calculate 7 day averages for Protests and Violence against Civilians\n\nacled$event_date&lt;-as.Date(acled$event_date,format=\"%d %B %Y\")\n#class(acled$event_date)\n\n##Compute number of events per day\n\nacled$perday&lt;-1\n\nprotests&lt;-filter(acled,event_type==\"Protests\" )\nstateviol&lt;-filter(acled, event_type==\"Violence against civilians\")\nprotests&lt;-aggregate(perday ~ event_date, data = protests, sum)\nstateviol&lt;-aggregate(perday ~ event_date, data = stateviol, sum)\n\n\n##Calculating a 7 day moving average\nprotests$rollmean&lt;-rollmean(protests$perday,k=7, fill=NA)\nstateviol$rollmean&lt;-rollmean(stateviol$perday,k=7, fill=NA)\n\nprotests &lt;- protests %&gt;% filter(protests$event_date &lt; \"2022-06-25\")\nstateviol &lt;- stateviol %&gt;% filter(stateviol$event_date &lt; \"2022-06-25\")\n\nprotestplot &lt;- ggplot(data=protests, aes(x=event_date, y=rollmean)) +\n  geom_line()+\n  geom_smooth() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=as.numeric(as.Date(\"2020-03-15\")), color=\"red\") +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"6 months\", date_labels = '%b %Y')  +\n  labs(x=\"Date\", y=\"Protests\", caption=\"7 day rolling averages; smoothed loess trend lines; red lines indicate 3.15.2020 COVID onset; 'ACLED data retrieved 7.18.22, http://acleddata.com\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Protests During the Pandemic\") \n   \n\nprotestplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepression\n\n\ncode\nrepressionplot &lt;- ggplot(data=stateviol, aes(x=event_date, y=rollmean)) +\n  geom_line()+\n  geom_smooth() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=as.numeric(as.Date(\"2020-03-15\")), color=\"red\") +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"6 months\", date_labels = '%b %Y')  +\n  labs(x=\"Date\", y=\"Violence against civilians\", caption=\"7 day rolling averages; smoothed loess trend lines; red lines indicate 3.15.2020 COVID onset; ACLED data retrieved 7.18.22, http://acleddata.com\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Violence Against Civilians During the Pandemic\") \n  \nrepressionplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStates of Emergency during the Pandemic\n\n\ncode\n####################\n#analysis data\n####################\n\n#make analysis data frame\nanalysisdata &lt;- left_join(perday, soe, by=c(\"ccode\"=\"ccode\", \"event_date\"=\"event_date\"))\nanalysisdata &lt;- left_join(analysisdata, covid, by=c(\"ccode\"=\"ccode\", \"event_date\"=\"date\"))\n\n#zeros for NA in soe_s\nanalysisdata &lt;- analysisdata %&gt;% mutate(across(soe_s, ~replace_na(., 0)))\n\n#fill soe series after onset\nanalysisdata &lt;- analysisdata %&gt;% group_by(ccode) %&gt;% mutate(cumSOE = cumsum(soe_s)) %&gt;% ungroup\n\n#plot cumulative states of emergency over time\ntotalsoe &lt;- analysisdata %&gt;% group_by(event_date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(across(cumSOE, sum)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() \n\ntotalsoe$event_date &lt;- as.Date(totalsoe$event_date)\n\ntotalsoe &lt;- totalsoe %&gt;% filter(event_date &gt;\"2020-01-01\"& event_date &lt;\"2020-07-01\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=totalsoe, aes(x=event_date, y=cumSOE))+\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 months\", date_labels = '%b %Y') +\n  labs ( colour = NULL, x = \"Date\", y =  \"Active States of Emergency\" )  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeling repression\nLet’s build a simple model predicting violence against civilians. The data here are daily, covering 167 countries between January 2020 and July 2022. We’ll predict the 7 day moving average of repression depending on whether a state of emergency is in place.\n\\(~\\)\nMy expectation is states of emergency will make repression easier to motivate and therefore, more frequent.\n\n\n\nThe model\n\\(y\\) = violence against civilians\n\\(x\\) = states of emergency\nControlling for:\n\nnew daily deaths from COVID (logged)\npercentage of the population over 65 years old\nthe Human Development Index\nthe 7 day average number of protests.\n\n\n\n\nModeling Repression and SoEs\n\n\ncode\n##################\n#models\n#################\n\nanalysisdata$soeprotests &lt;- analysisdata$cumSOE*analysisdata$protest7day\nanalysisdata$lnd =  log(analysisdata$new_deaths+.01)\n#label variables for coef plot\nlibrary(\"labelled\")\nanalysisdata &lt;- analysisdata %&gt;%\n  set_variable_labels(\n    cumSOE = \"State of Emergency\",\n    lnd = \"ln(New COVID deaths)\",\n    aged_65_older = \"% age 65 +\",\n    human_development_index = \"Human Development Index\",\n    protest7day = \"Protests, 7 day avg\",\n    soeprotests = \"SoE * Protests, 7 day avg\", \n    `Violence against civilians` = \"Violence against Civilians\"\n  )\n\n#model predicting repression during covid \n\nm1 &lt;- lm(data=analysisdata, `Violence against civilians` ~ cumSOE  + lnd + aged_65_older+human_development_index + protest7day )\n#summary(m1)  \n\nlibrary(sjPlot)\ntab_model(m1, show.se=TRUE,  p.style=\"stars\", show.ci=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nViolence against\nCivilians\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nstd.

Can we reasonably set all the \\(X\\) variables to zero?\nthe difference between a state with a SoE and without is different from zero, but quite small; 0.13 uses of violence.\nmore deaths from COVID are associated with more violence against civilians; \\(ln(\\beta) = .05\\). Exponentiate that, and the effect on violence is 1.05, so large compared to anything else in the model.\n\n\n\n\nQuantities of interest (simulation)\nLet’s generate predictions from the model by simulating the distribution of \\(\\widehat{\\beta}\\):\n\nsample 1000 times from a multivariate normal distribution with mean \\(\\widehat{\\beta}\\)s and variances of \\(var(\\widehat{\\beta})\\).\nplug those simulated \\(\\widehat{\\beta}\\)s into the equation using mean/median/mode values for the \\(X\\)s.\n\n\n\n\nSimulating quantities\nFirst, set \\(SoE = 0\\); vary \\(covid~deaths = ln(1 \\ldots 28000)\\), \\(\\%~age~ 65 = 6\\) (the median), \\(HDI = .74\\) (the median), and \\(protests = 2\\) (the median).\n\\[ \\widehat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*   0 +\\beta_2*log(p) + \\beta_3*6 +\\beta_4*.74+ \\beta_5*2 \\]\nthen, repeat but with \\(SoE = 1\\):\n\\[ \\widehat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*1 +\\beta_2*log(p) + \\beta_3*6 +\\beta_4*.74+ \\beta_5*2 \\]\n\n\n\nPredicted Violence against Civilians\n\n\ncode\n#simulated quantities\nsigma &lt;- vcov(m1)\nB &lt;- data.frame(rmvnorm(n=1000, mean=coef(m1), vcov(m1)))\n\ncolnames(B) &lt;-c('b0', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'b4', 'b5')\n\npredictions &lt;- data.frame ( lb0 = numeric(0),med0= numeric(0),\n      ub0= numeric(0),lb1= numeric(0),med1= numeric(0),ub1= \n      numeric(0), deaths = numeric(0))\n\nfor (p in seq(0,28000,100)) {\n  \n  xbRA0  &lt;- quantile(B$b0 + B$b1*0 + B$b2*log(p) + B$b3*6 +B$b4*.74+ \n                       B$b5*2, probs=c(.025,.5,.975))\n  xbRA1 &lt;- quantile(B$b0 + B$b1*1 + B$b2*log(p) + B$b3*6 +B$b4*.74+ \n                      B$b5*2, probs=c(.025,.5,.975))\n  xbRA0&lt;- data.frame(t(xbRA0))\n  xbRA1&lt;- data.frame(t(xbRA1))\n  predictions[p:p,] &lt;- data.frame(xbRA0, xbRA1, p)\n}\npredictions$deaths &lt;- log(predictions$deaths)\n\n#plot \nggplot()+\n  geom_ribbon(data=predictions, aes(x=deaths, ymin=lb0, ymax=ub0),fill = \"grey70\", alpha = .4, ) +\n  geom_ribbon(data=predictions, aes(x=deaths, ymin=lb1, ymax=ub1), fill= \"grey60\",  alpha = .4, ) +\n  geom_line(data= predictions, aes(x=deaths, y=med0))+\n  geom_line(data= predictions, aes(x=deaths, y=med1))+\n  labs ( colour = NULL, x = \"ln(New COVID Deaths)\", y =  \"Expected Repression Episodes\" ) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 5.5, y = .82, label = \"State of Emergency\", size=3.5, colour=\"gray30\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 6.5, y = .55, label = \"No State of Emergency\", size=3.5, colour=\"gray30\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nSoE states have higher levels of violence against civilians, but the difference is very small, making me think we haven’t found anything particularly interesting here.\n\nCovid deaths is associated with more violence; though violence nearly doubles over the range of deaths (x-axis), the range is huge - from 1 to 28,000. If we transform the x-axis to deaths rather than \\(ln(deaths)\\), we can see this effect is pretty isolated.\n\n\n\n\nSimulated effects (again)\n\n\ncode\npredictions$deaths &lt;- exp(predictions$deaths)\n\n#plot \nggplot()+\n  geom_ribbon(data=predictions, aes(x=deaths, ymin=lb0, ymax=ub0),fill = \"grey70\", alpha = .4, ) +\n  geom_ribbon(data=predictions, aes(x=deaths, ymin=lb1, ymax=ub1), fill= \"grey60\",  alpha = .4, ) +\n  geom_line(data= predictions, aes(x=deaths, y=med0))+\n  geom_line(data= predictions, aes(x=deaths, y=med1))+\n  labs ( colour = NULL, x = \"New COVID Deaths\", y =  \"Expected Repression Episodes\" ) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 5000, y = 1, label = \"State of Emergency\", size=3.5, colour=\"gray30\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 10000, y = .65, label = \"No State of Emergency\", size=3.5, colour=\"gray30\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe increase in violence occurs almost entirely between zero and 5000 COVID deaths. We can speculate on why this might be; doing so might lead us to wonder how useful this model is.\n\\(~\\) \\(~\\)\nThat’s the primary question we’ll ask this semester."
