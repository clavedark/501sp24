Created with Quarto. 

About me:

Professor of political science, PhD Florida State 1999. I've taught this class for a long time, but never the same way twice. I study models of political violence, collect data on [protests](https://massmobilization.github.io) and repression. 

<!-- My real effort in the last 15 years or so has been to retool it into a data-science-heavy class to leave students with modern coding, data wrangling, and modeling tools. -->
